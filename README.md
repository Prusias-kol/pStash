# pStash
Thank you to Thoth19 providing the framework with clan_stash.ash. Without his regex, I would not have the willpower to make this script.

This script functions as a CLI interface to check and manage shared clan stashes.

To install, run   
```
git checkout https://github.com/Prusias-kol/pStash main
```
